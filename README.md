# Ansible Jenkins Installation

This branch, `0.2_ansible_install_jenkins`, contains the necessary files to install Jenkins on an EC2 instance created by Terraform in the previous branch, `0.1_create_ec2_tf`. 

## About the Project

In the previous branch, `0.1_create_ec2_tf`, we set up EC2 instances using Terraform. Now, we will use Ansible to install Jenkins on the created EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

- An Ubuntu EC2 instance created using the Terraform code from the `0.1_create_ec2_tf` branch.
- The `deployer` key pair generated by Terraform for accessing the EC2 instance.

## Installing Ansible on Ubuntu

```
#1.Update the package list by running the command:
sudo apt update

#2.Install the software-properties-common package by running the command:
sudo apt install software-properties-common

#3. Add the Ansible repository by running the command:
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible

#4. Install Ansible by running the command:

sudo apt install ansible
```

## Installing Jenkins using Ansible Playbook

1. Clone the repository to your local machine, if you haven't already, by running the command:

2. Switch to the `0.2_ansible_install_jenkins` branch by running the command:

3. Navigate to the `ansible` directory by running the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/manikcloud/Jenkins-cicd.git
git checkout 0.2_ansible_install_jenkins
cd ansible

```
4. Update the `hosts` file in the `ansible` directory with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
5. Run the Ansible playbook to install Jenkins using the deployer key pair by running the command:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts --private-key=../deployer jenkins.yaml
```
6. Once the playbook is executed, Jenkins will be installed on the EC2 instance.

Note: Replace the path to the deployer key pair with the correct path if necessary.
