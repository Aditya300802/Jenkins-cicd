# Ansible Jenkins Installation

This branch, `0.2_ansible_install_jenkins`, contains the necessary files to install Jenkins on an EC2 instance created by Terraform in the previous branch, `0.1_create_ec2_tf`. 

## About the Project

In the previous branch, `0.1_create_ec2_tf`, we set up EC2 instances using Terraform. Now, we will use Ansible to install Jenkins on the created EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

- An Ubuntu EC2 instance created using the Terraform code from the `0.1_create_ec2_tf` branch.
- The `deployer` key pair generated by Terraform for accessing the EC2 instance.

## Installing Ansible on Ubuntu

```
#1.Update the package list by running the command:
sudo apt update

#2.Install the software-properties-common package by running the command:
sudo apt install software-properties-common

#3. Add the Ansible repository by running the command:
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible

#4. Install Ansible by running the command:

sudo apt install ansible
```

## Installing Jenkins using Ansible Playbook

1. Clone the repository to your local machine, if you haven't already, by running the command:

2. Switch to the `0.2_ansible_install_jenkins` branch by running the command:

3. Navigate to the `ansible` directory by running the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/manikcloud/Jenkins-cicd.git
git checkout 0.2_ansible_install_jenkins
cd ansible

```
## Check the connectivity from remote VM

1. To get the public IP of the VM created by Terraform, run the following command:

```
terraform output
```

This will display the output variables from your Terraform configuration. Look for the variable containing the public IP address and copy it.

2. Use the Ansible ad-hoc `ping` command to check the connectivity to the EC2 instance by running the command:

```
ansible all -i 'X.X.X.X,' --private-key=path/to/deployer -m ping
```

Replace `X.X.X.X` with the public IP address you just copied, and `path/to/deployer` with the correct path to your deployer key pair.

If the connectivity is successful, you will see output similar to the following:

```
X.X.X.X | SUCCESS => {
"ansible_facts": {
"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
},
"changed": false,
"ping": "pong"
}
```
4. Update the `hosts` file in the `ansible` directory with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
5. Run the Ansible playbook to install Jenkins using the deployer key pair by running the command:

```
ansible-playbook -i X.X.X.X,  --private-key=../deployer ansible/jenkins.yaml
```
6. Once the playbook is executed, Jenkins will be installed on the EC2 instance.

Note: Replace the path to the deployer key pair with the correct path if necessary.
